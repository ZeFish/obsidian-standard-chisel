## ✨ Features

### 🖼️ Intelligent Media Manager
Stop cluttering your vault with randomly dumped screenshots and attachments.
- **Rule-Based Routing**: Route incoming media automatically to dedicated asset folders relative to each note or at a global vault root.
- **Clean Naming & Slugification**: Transform clumsy filenames like `CleanShot 2026-09-20 at 11.23.45.png` into clean, human-readable slugs.
- **Deduplication**: Automatically detects duplicate attachments using content hashes to prevent storage bloat.
- **Mobile & Sync Friendly**: Carefully guarded against sync conflicts and mobile file-system lag.

### 🎨 Snippets & Typography Engine
Refine your vault's visual identity note by note.
- **Note-Scoped Styling**: Dynamically apply styling rules and CSS snippets driven by frontmatter metadata (`cssclasses`, `theme`, or custom tags).
- **Custom Font Offloader**: Embed and manage high-quality web fonts directly inside your vault with an optimized, lightweight base64 engine.
- **Global CSS Cache**: Precompiles and persists stylesheets to `data.json` for lightning-fast startup on both desktop and mobile without recomputing heavy fonts.

### 🧘 Zen Interface Manager
Create a calm writing sanctuary whenever you need deep focus.
- **Distraction-Free Canvas**: Instantly collapse sidebars, ribbon buttons, tab headers, and status bars with a single toggle or hotkey.
- **Custom Chrome Rules**: Selectively show or hide individual Obsidian interface elements to tailor your ideal writing environment.

### 📖 E-ink & Reader Optimization
Built from experience for e-ink tablets (Onyx Boox, Supernote, Kindle Scribe, reMarkable).
- **High-Contrast Reader**: Crisp monochromatic typography and ultra-sharp line rendering tuned specifically for grayscale e-ink displays.
- **Zero-Latency Layouts**: Disables unnecessary visual animations and heavy blur effects to maximize responsiveness on e-paper screens.

### 🧭 Navigation & Workflow Essentials
- **Daily Navigation**: Fast keyboard shortcuts to navigate back and forth through daily journal entries.
- **Scroll Position Memory**: Preserves exact scroll states across pane switches and workspace reloads.
- **Base64 Fold**: Neatly collapses long base64 embedded data in the editor so your markdown stays clean and readable.
